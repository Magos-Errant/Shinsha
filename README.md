# Shinsha
 Discord bot written using discordpy library

# About
 Shinsha (辰砂 - Cinnabar in Japanese) is a discord bot with many various functionalities, accessible by messages. Some messages require having higher user privilege.
There's nothing too complicated here. Functionalities have been inspired by other open-sourced bots, and tweaked to our needs.

And before you ask, we don't watch Houseki no Kuni. The name is meant to not mean anything in particular.

# Installation
 Written entirely in python, Shinsha requires latest version of
* pybooru
* discord
* setuptools
* NyaaPy

You should be able to install them with pip. Everything else is provided with latest Python3. `git clone` this repository to your python environment (or anywhere).
Create a `Token.txt` file in main directory and paste your bot account's token, no spaces or anything. It goes without saying that this token should not be shared with anyone.
Once done, run `main.py`.

If you plan on using this bot for whatever reason, we are very happy to hear that. If you encounter any problems, create an issue.

# Function summary
 !help command is good enough for now.
